# Work Day Scheduler


## Webpage Description
This is a calendar application that allows a user to save tasks for each hour of a typical 9am-5pm work day. The calendar is loaded dynamically through JavaScript.

The user can enter their tasks for any time slot and hit the corresponding save button to it's right. Upon hitting this save, the task is added to localstorage. If the user refreshes or returns to the browser, the application will load the saved calendar in local storage so that the user can pick up were they left off.

The calendar will also color code based on if the time was in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green). This will update whenever the user refreshes the page.
